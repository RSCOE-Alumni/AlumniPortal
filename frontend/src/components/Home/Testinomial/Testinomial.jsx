            entirely new approach of learning in our college. An approach, where
            traditional methods of learning go hand in hand with modern learning
            techniques, keeping with the current trends and technology. We
            facilitate our students to excel academically and to develop their
            personalities in diverse fields. To this end, we have complemented
            academics with other developmental activities such as performing
            arts, sports, hobbies and technical clubs, to name a few. Each
            student is encouraged to explore their areas of interest and to
            develop their talent to the maximum. Our teaching staff is dedicated
            and knowledgeable in their subjects. They have a passion to pass on
            this enthusiasm to each student and to inculcate in them the spirit
            of curiosity and learning.
            <br /> Atttention is given to each student to focus on their
            strengths and to develop confidence. This would stand them in good
            stead, once student graduates from our college, to encounter life’s
            problems on their own We, at Rajarshi Shahu College Of Engineering,
            strive to cultivate students who are not only successful in their
            personal and professional fields, but who take upon themselves the
            challenge to fetch science and technology to the doorsteps of the
            common man and to propel India as the leader in the emerging
            technologies We welcome you to our college to interact with our
            staff. After your visit to our campus, you will feel assured about
            the excellent infrastructure we have developed. This will enable you
            to choose the best for your child. We believe that you are coming

            overall personality development will lead to placements, higher

            to provide an opportunity for students to innovate, explore and
            evolve. Apart from creating an academic environment, students are
            motivated to excel in co-curricular, extra-curricular and community
            developmental activities. Our ultimate aim has always been: Bringing
            the best out of every student - leading to a ‘Complete Professional’
